# Project Interbank COBOL Academy

![Logo](./assets/logo.svg)

## Introduction

The project carried out in the Python programming language aims to analyze a dataset called ``data.csv`` that is in the .csv format. This analysis can be performed through different libraries such as Pandas, which was used on this occasion, with the objective of performing the following analyses:

- **final balance:**  
  Sum of the amounts of "Credit" type transactions minus the sum of the amounts of "Debit" type transactions.

- **Transaction with the Highest Amount:**  
  Identify the ID and amount of the transaction with the highest value.

- **Transaction Count:**  
   Calculate the total number of transactions grouped by type ('Credit' and 'Debit')."

## Execution Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diegoguerra11/interbank-academy-25.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd interbank-academy-25
   ```

3. Ensure you have created a virtual environment named ``.venv``:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (depending on your operating system):
   ```bash
   .venv/Scripts/activate (windows)
   .venv/bin/activate (linux or macOS)
   ```

5. Ensure that all dependencies are installed. If they aren’t, you can install them using ``pip``:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the project script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Approach and Solution

The main approach of the project, written in ``Python``, is to maintain clean code by separating responsibilities, using coherent and understandable variable names, and handling exceptions properly. This ensures that the code is readable and easily maintainable by any other developer.

As part of the solution, the pandas library was used, which allows reading various types of data files — in this case, ``.csv`` files. This made it possible to create a ``DataFrame`` from the data in order to perform the required calculations. Several functions with clearly defined responsibilities were implemented and organized in the ``./utils`` folder. This helps keep the main script clean and abstracts the logic used for data processing.
